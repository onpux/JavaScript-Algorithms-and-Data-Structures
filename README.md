# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This project demonstrates core concepts of algorithms and data structures using only JavaScript. No dependencies or terminal usage required: just copy the files and open them in your browser.

## Demonstrated Capabilities
- **Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and recursion techniques.
- **Logical Problem Solving**: Example problems and solutions to develop algorithmic thinking.

## How to use this project?
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the main HTML file in your browser.
3. Explore and modify the JavaScript code to experiment with different algorithms and data structures.

## Recommended structure
- `index.html`: Main structure and interface of the project.
- `algorithms.js`: JavaScript code for algorithms and data structures.
- `styles.css`: Custom styles for the interface.

## Customization
You can add your own algorithms, data structures, or problem solutions by editing the `algorithms.js` file.
